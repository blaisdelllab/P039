P003f - Behavioral Variability Under Omission, Instrumental,
Pavlovian, and Extinction Contingencies
----------------------------------------------------------

Created on Mon Jan 9 2023

Last updated: 2025-04-09

@authors: Megan C. & Cyrus K.

This project investigated the roles of various scedules of reinforcement 
(Pavlovian, instrumental, and omission contingencies) in dictating spatial 
and temoporal response variability. It also accounted for proximity to
reinforcement by modifying the number of responses to reach each trial's
outcome; this manipulation occured each phase.

All subjects underwent three phases: RR2, RR5, and RR20 (changed from RR10 after
we found that it was too low). Across each session of each phase, trials could
be one of three types (the reinforcement schedules described above), 
differentiated by stimulus color--nine distinct colors were
counter-balanced across twelve subjects. 

Each trial lasted 10 seconds. Within these 10 s, responses on and off the
presented cue were tracked and could impact the outcome of the trial.
